MntJUlip Output File Guide
===========================

After running MntJUlip for intron-level splicing analysis, your output directory will contain several result files. Here's what each one means:

1. *.introns
-------------
- Description: Lists all detected introns.
- Includes: chromosome, start, end, strand, read counts, edit counts.
- Use: For filtering, gene assignment, and coverage stats.

2. *.counts
------------
- Description: Raw intron read counts per sample.
- Format: Tab-separated table with introns as rows and samples as columns.

3. *.DSR.tsv (Differential Splicing Ratio)
------------------------------------------
- Description: Tests for changes in intron usage ratio between conditions.
- Includes: Intron ID, gene, ratio per condition, fold change, p-value, adjusted p-value.
- Use: Detects events like exon skipping.

4. *.DSA.tsv (Differential Splicing Abundance)
----------------------------------------------
- Description: Tests for differences in total intron read counts.
- Includes: Same structure as DSR.
- Use: Highlights introns that increase/decrease strongly.

5. *.signif.tsv or *.sig.dsr/dsa.tsv
-------------------------------------
- Description: Filtered list of significant introns from DSR/DSA.
- Criteria: FDR < 0.05, fold change thresholds.

6. *.json or *.log
-------------------
- Description: Metadata, parameters, and logs.
- Use: Reproducibility and debugging.

7. *.genes or *.assigned_genes
-------------------------------
- Description: Maps introns to genes using the GTF annotation.
- Use: Biological interpretation.

How to Interpret Results
-------------------------
Example row from DSR.tsv:
chr1:100-200:+   ABC1   0.75   0.35   2.1   0.0005   0.01
- Intron in gene ABC1 has a higher splicing ratio in condition 1.
- Fold change: 2.1x
- Adjusted p-value: 0.01 â†’ statistically significant

Visualization Tips
-------------------
- Use IGV or Sashimi plots for individual introns.
- Plot DSR/DSA results using heatmaps or volcano plots in R/Python.
