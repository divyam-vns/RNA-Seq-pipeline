# Step-by-Step Guide to Event-Level Analysis with rMATS

## ðŸ§¬ Overview of rMATS Output

rMATS outputs:
- `summary.txt`: Summary of detected events
- `*.MATS.JC.txt` and `*.MATS.JCEC.txt`: Event-level data for 5 splicing types
- `fromGTF.*.txt` and `fromGTF.novelEvents.*.txt`: Annotated and novel splicing events

## âœ… Step 1: Start with `summary.txt`

- Lists events: SE, MXE, A5SS, A3SS, RI
- Shows number of significant events using JC and JCEC
- Uses q-value < 0.05 for significance

## âœ… Step 2: JC vs JCEC Files

- JC: Junction counts only (spliced reads)
- JCEC: Junction + exon body reads (more sensitive)

## âœ… Step 3: Explore `*.MATS.JC.txt` or `*.MATS.JCEC.txt`

Key columns:
- Inclusion/Skipping counts for both samples
- IncLevel1 / IncLevel2: PSI values
- IncLevelDifference: Î”PSI = PSI(Sample1) - PSI(Sample2)
- FDR (q-value) for significance

## âœ… Step 4: Filter Significant Events (Example for SE.MATS.JC.txt)

```bash
awk 'NR>1 && $20 < 0.05 && ($23 > 0.05 || $23 < -0.05)' SE.MATS.JC.txt > SE_filtered.txt
```

## âœ… Step 5: Understand `fromGTF.*.txt`

These map events to known annotation and novel events.

## âœ… Step 6: Visualize PSI and Î”PSI

Create histograms and volcano plots using Python.

## Thresholds
- q-value < 0.05
- |Î”PSI| â‰¥ 0.05
